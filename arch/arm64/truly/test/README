 According to section C5.1.2 
  the 21-th bit ,aka as the L bit = 0x200000
 is an undefined opcode when in conjunction with op0 = 0b0x
 This means, that opcodes bellow that 0xD52fffff to D520000, 
  may some special opcodes that exits only within certain ARMv8 implementations
 and may be used to differentiate between the different models

So I reached this opcode in the emulation, and then it stucked.
 0:	d51cd060 	msr	s3_4_c13_c0_3, x0

The next command 0xd51cd05f must be skipped as it clears tpidr_el2 itself.
